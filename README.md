# Hangman Project!
Hey! 
I've been trying to learn python and also how to use github and get comfortable with it.
- This is a project I made or rather modified for my college project based on python GUI.
- was able to complete this project by referring to the the yt tutorial  
[tech with tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEO1B_llDnc)
- although I did copy pasted the code, but I still managed to modify it alot by myself by reasearching and investing hours in it.
- Please feel free to add any more changes or add new features in this project such as a game menu.
